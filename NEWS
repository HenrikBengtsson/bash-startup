   following options to be ignored _unless_ positional.

   positional ones.


Version: 0.4.0 [2018-01-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Calling 'startup' without arguments is now the same as 'startup --help'.

 * Directories and files prefixed with double periods are now always ignored,
   e.g. /path/..to/script.sh and /path/to/..script.sh.
    

Version: 0.3.0 [2017-12-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add startup_source().
 
 * Renamed bash_startup() to startup().
 
 * Renamed source_d() to startup_source_d().
 
 * Now all ("public") functions are prefixed with 'startup_' and all
   "private" functions are prefixed with '_startup_'.

 * startup() gained option --reset for resetting the timer.

 * startup() gained option --non-x for sourcing also script without the
   executable flag set.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: More unit tests.


Version: 0.2.2 [2017-12-15]

BUG FIXES:

 * startup_find_all_keys() would incorrectly identify filename extensions
   as keys.
   
 * Output functions produced 'tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified'
   if TERM was not set.  Now 'tput' (for colored output) is only used if
   supported.
 
 * key=value pairs did not acknowledge periods (.), e.g. 'abc.def=123' would
   be parsed as key='abc.def' not as 'def'.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: More unit tests.


Version: 0.2.1 [2017-12-12]
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added shellcheck tests ('make check'), which also run on Travis CI.
 

Version: 0.2.0 [2017-12-11]

NEW FEATURES:

 * source_d() now supports key=value and key!=value filtering where 'key'
   is any environment variable or one of the predefined built-in keys,
   i.e. 'interactive'.  Note that it will only filter on the key if its
   value is non-empty.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added unit tests ('make test'), which run on Travis CI.


Version: 0.1.0 [2017-12-10]

 * Created bash-startup script with functions generalized from a set of
   in-house functions created over a few years.
